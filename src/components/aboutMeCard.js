                    I am a first-class physics graduate and experienced full-stack software engineer, currently based in

                    Until recently I have worked for scientific instrument companies where I researched, designed
                    and implemented instrument control software and data science solutions for Mass Spectrometers. üî¨
                    My background and knowledge allowed me to excel in interpreting scientific and software concepts
                    from relevant parties and improving communication between departments.

                    What I am most proud of during this time is improving the self- diagnostic abilities of the
                    instruments
                    and automating previously complex setup procedures which made these instruments more accessible to
                    less
                    technical users! üòÄ The systems I have contributed towards have been recognised as part of the
                    solution for the Pfizer ‚Äì
