                    I've recently completed an MSc in Data Science at the University of Edinburgh. For my dissertation
                    entitled: "Segmentation of Windthrow in High Resolution Capella SAR Images Using Fully Convolutional Networks"
                    I worked part time as a data scientist at

                    My ultimate ambition is to pursue a career where I can utilise my skills to
                    to tackle some of our biggest environmental challenges. I'm currently pursuing this at

                    where I combine deep learning and satellite data to bring transparency to the carbon
                    markets.

                    Before that I worked on the

                    Previously I worked for analytical instrumentation companies where I developed instrument control software
                    and data science solutions. I am most proud of improving the self- diagnostic abilities of the instruments
                    and automating previously complex setup procedures which made these instruments more accessible to
                    less technical users! The systems I have contributed towards have been recognised as part of the
                    solution for the Pfizer â€“ BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine!
